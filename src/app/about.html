          <h3> Who made it</h3>
          <p> Pitching pathways was made from the idea of our CEO Peyton Loeffelbein he hated how he wasn't able to find the latest and trending AI that could help us in the future so he came up with the idea of coming up with a place to do so and this was how the idea of Pitching Pathways was formed</p>
          <p> Propelling this idea into action he reached out to the person we now know as the CFO Phuoc Hua to build the website and bring the idea to life they came up with an idea to build a team to make this small bud of light that they call Pitching Pathways come to life</p>
